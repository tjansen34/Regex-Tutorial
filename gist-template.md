# Regex Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll examine various aspects of regular expressions (regex) by analyzing a comprehensive regex pattern designed to match and validate email addresses. This regex pattern will serve as our guide to understanding key concepts such as anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, the OR operator, flags, and character escapes. Whether you're a beginner looking to grasp the basics or an experienced user aiming to refine your skills.

## Summary

In this guide, we'll explore various aspects of regular expressions (regex) by breaking down a comprehensive regex pattern. The regex pattern we'll use is designed to match and validate email addresses. We'll discuss anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, the OR operator, flags, and character escapes.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

    Anchors serve to specify the location within the input string where a match is intended. Rather than matching specific characters, anchors they define points in the string where certain conditions must be met.

### Quantifiers

    quantifiers are symbols that specify the quantity or range of times a character or group of characters should occur. They allow you to identify patterns of varying lengths

### Grouping Constructs

    Grouping constructs are used to grouping multiple elements into a singular entity. This proves beneficial when applying quantifiers, and various other operations to a specific group of characters. The parentheses () are the most common form of grouping construct.

### Bracket Expressions

    Bracket expressions are used to match any one of a set of characters. They are defined by enclosing a list of characters inside square brackets [ ]. For example, the regular expression [aeiou] matches any one vowel.

### Character Classes

    character classes allow you to match any one of a set of characters. They are defined using square brackets [ ]. Character class is a term often used to refer specifically to the set of characters defined within square brackets

### The OR Operator

    The vertical bar (|) serves as the representation of the "OR" operator in regular expressions. It functions as a logical OR, enabling the specification of alternative patterns. It will match either the pattern on its left or the pattern on its right.

### Flags

    Flags are parameters that modify the behavior of the pattern matching. Flags are added to the end of a regular expression and are typically represented by single characters.

### Character Escapes

    character escapes are used to represent characters with special meanings, such as metacharacters. When aiming to match a character that is also a metacharacter, it is necessary to precede it with a backslash \ .

    Here are some common character escapes in regex:

        \d: Matches any digit (0-9).
        \D: Matches any non-digit.
        \w: Matches any word character (alphanumeric + underscore).
        \W: Matches any non-word character.
        \s: Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline).
        \S: Matches any non-whitespace character.
        \.: Matches a literal dot (period).
